# Development workflow and handoff

Start each session here. Read the [current requirements](SRS.md), [technical plan](TRD.md), and [decision log](DECISIONS.md) before changing the optimizer. Check the Git diff and use the current implementation and tests to verify this handoff.

| Stage | Work | Check before proceeding |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Baseline command | Add `build.sh`, the Python `kopt` entry point, and the permitted kit code it uses. Read the machine and emit the input unchanged. | The documented command works from a clean checkout and from another directory. |
| 2. First passes | Implement local constant folding and copy propagation, then add liveness and dead pure code removal. | Verify a beneficial rewrite and a case where each pass must preserve the original behavior. |
| 3. Batch validation | Compare originals with optimized outputs under the official validator, then measure cycles with the simulator. | Check public workloads across supplied machines, repeated-run determinism, and runtime on a generated large program. |
| 4. Performance work | Add fusion, register reuse, or scheduling in separate changes. | Keep changes with measured benefits. Investigate slower cases and retain a reproducer for failures. |
| 5. Submission | Update the root README and the seven required design sections. Build from a clean checkout and record demo and benchmark evidence. | Review the submission checklist and confirm organizer access before sending the repository link. |

For each change, write down the fact that makes the rewrite safe. Add a small test when the public suite would miss the failure mode. Start with `const_chain`, `junk_dead`, and `common_subexpr` for wins, then run `dead_div_trap`, `sensor_sum`, and `alias_hazard` as guardrails. Include same-input cycle comparisons and record skipped validator inputs separately from passing inputs.

## Current handoff

- **State** — Release validation and the replayable demo are ready. Run `sh tests/demo.sh /path/to/LLH-26/Compilers/COMP10`. The repository contains all four required top-level files, executable entry points with LF line endings, and no copies of the organizer's benchmark or machine folders.
- **Latest evidence** — Thirty-five CLI tests passed. All 500 public samples and 32,000 generated inputs matched across five machines. Constant propagation improved five pairs over `b21dada` and tied 495. The default sample total fell from 24,127 to 24,067 cycles against 103,671 original cycles. `constant_branch` dropped from 187 to 127 cycles on the default machine and from 747 to 127 on the four-register machine.
- **Fresh programs** — Run `python3 tests/stress.py /path/to/LLH-26/Compilers/COMP10`. Seeds 60723 and 921730 passed 9,600 comparisons across four machines. A targeted matrix checked 24,576 executions across eight machines, including 4,192 traps. Two roughly 100,000-instruction tests exercised full propagation and the budget fallback. Both produced identical output across two hash seeds and matched the interpreter on three inputs each.
- **Earlier verification** — Ubuntu 22.04 x86-64 with Python 3.10.12 passed the build, demo, 500 public samples, 32,000 generated inputs, and 4,800 fresh-program comparisons after jump cleanup. [Ubuntu run](https://github.com/oki-dokii/Oxygen-Debt/actions/runs/42815272105)
- **Next performance target** — Test replacing simple, effect-free conditional assignments with `select`. Start with `branchy_select` and measure the tradeoff between fewer taken jumps and computing both candidate values.
- **Handoff** — Confirm the organizers have read access to the private repository, then submit the repository link through the event's submission channel.
- **Update before ending a session** — Record the latest verified command or benchmark, any open issue, and the next concrete step. Update [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) for shipped passes and [Decisions](DECISIONS.md) for changed choices.
